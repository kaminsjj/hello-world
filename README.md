# hello-world
A place to learn operating GitHub, store ideas, try and discuss things.

Hi, I'm Julius. I started with GitHub just some seconds ago. In the next months I'd like to learn some basic coding skills. I wanna learn how to set up responsive Web apps, especially for using it in medical education. Furthermore I'm interested in understanding some data science and AI fundamentals.
